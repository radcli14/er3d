    "Yaw → Pitch → Roll": "The Yaw → Pitch → Roll Euler angle sequence is common in aerospace applications, and is often referred to as a 3-2-1 sequence based on the order the three angles are applied. In our example, we depict orientation of a ship relative to a local geodetic horizon plane with a X=North, Y=East, Z=Down (or, NED) convention.",
    "Yaw": "The yaw angle (ψ) is a rotation about the Z-axis of the base frame. If we use a NED convention, then we may think of yaw as a compass angle:\n  - ψ = 0deg → facing north\n  - ψ = 45deg → facing northeast\n  - ψ = 90deg → facing east\n  ... etc",
    "Pitch": "The pitch angle (𝜃) is a rotation about the y′-axis of the first rotated frame, after yaw rotation. If we use a NED convention, then we may think of pitch as the slope:\n  - 𝜃 = 0deg → level\n  - 𝜃 = 45deg → facing uphill\n  - 𝜃 = -45deg → facing downhill\n  ... etc",
    "Roll": "The roll angle (φ) is a rotation about the x″-axis of the second rotated frame, after yaw and pitch rotation. If we use a NED convention, then we may think of roll as a banking maneuver to turn:\n  - φ = 0deg → straight\n  - φ = 45deg → banked right\n  - φ = -45deg → banked left\n  ... etc",
    
    "Procession → Nutation → Spin": "abcdef",
    "Procession": "ghijk",
    "Nutation": "lmnop",
    "Spin": "qrstuv",
    
    "Latitude & Longitude": "Latitude and longitude angles in degrees are commonly used to define a location on the surface of the earth. Latitude defines a location in north-south coordinates, and longitude in east-west coordinates.",
    "Latitude": "Lines of constant latitude run parallel to the Earth's equator, with zero latitude being on the equator itself. Increasing latitude above zero indicates more northerly locations, while negative is more southerly. Maximum and minimum latitude at the poles are 90 and -90 degrees.",
    "Longitude": "Lines of constant longitude run from the north to the south pole. Zero longitude is known as the Prime Meridian, and crosses through Greenwich, England, sections of France, Spain, and Western Africa. Increasing longitude indicates moving east, while decreasing indicates moving west."
